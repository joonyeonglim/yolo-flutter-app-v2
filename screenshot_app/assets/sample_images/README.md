# Sample Images

Place your sample images here for testing the screenshot app.

Images should be:
- Less than 1MB in size to comply with GitHub's file size limits
- In PNG or JPEG format
- Representative of the types of images you want to test YOLO inference on

Example images for different YOLO tasks:
- Detection: images with multiple objects (people, vehicles, animals)
- Segmentation: images with clear object boundaries
- Classification: single object images
- Pose: images with people in various poses
- OBB: aerial or rotated object images
